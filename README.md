## Script to randomly delete sequences from files in fasta or fastq format.

###From range of sequences from file randomly deletes defined number of sequences and puts it into output file.
###All the fasta file content is loaded into memory so much depend on a file size. Dealing with whole libraries will be usually not manageable for regular PCs.

####For the moment it only takes fasta paired ends as input.

USAGE:
```
fasta_random_trimming.py <paired_ends_1> <paired_ends_2> <output_1> <output_2> <number of seq to delete>
```
